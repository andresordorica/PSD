This code is designed to determine the Pore Size Distribution (PSD) within a simulation cell, applicable to any type of porous or amorphous materials. The implementation follows the Grid Point Approach and Cavity Method:

In the provided example.ipynb, a random distribution of points is generated, simulating a series of atoms within a simulation box. To use actual coordinate data from a GROMACS .gro file, a helper function is included in this repository.

To use an actual .gro file, replace the random data with the following:
file_path = os.getcwd()  # Path where the .gro file is located
gro_file_path = os.path.join(file_path, "NPT.gro")  # Name of the .gro file
data, box_dimensions = transcribe_gro_radius(gro_file_path)  # The function returns the data in array format and the box dimensions
